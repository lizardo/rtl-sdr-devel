Description: Turns your Realtek RTL2832 based DVB dongle into a SDR receiver
 Much software is available for the RTL2832. Most of the user-level packages
 rely on the librtlsdr library which comes as part of the rtl-sdr codebase.
 This codebase contains both the library itself and also a number of command
 line tools such as rtl_test, rtl_sdr, rtl_tcp, and rtl_fm. These command line
 tools use the library to test for the existence of RTL2832 devices and to
 perform basic data transfer functions to and from the device.
